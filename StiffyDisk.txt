	SDD
		Stiffy Disk Drive
			Cuz it's stiff

		Solid Disk Drive
			Cuz it's using SSD technology
"NeoFloppy"
	Taking The Concept of the 3,5" FDD to the next level
		Mechanically
			Staying with the 3,5" form factor for cost savings
				Dimensions: 93.7 x 90.0 x 3.3 mm
				Existing Mechanisms
				Existing Cases & Packaging
				Lack of 3,5" drives in modern PCs is avoidin most confusion
				Also the 3,5" form factor is mechanically and haptically excellent
					https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJCMzdzh4Tw
			Or changing to a smaller form factor that is considered more efficient
				Still providing enough space for labels.
					1,8"
						Similar to Intel's SSDs

					Other
						Similar to ExpressCard/34
							https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExpressCard
				Allowing better mechanical tolerances & Adding RFID+NFC Tags to it
					Enabling Autoloaders and Robots to reliably handle media
						Compareable to LTO Ultrium Cartridges
							https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Tape-Open
			More stable
				Sheetmetal [Aluminium] Case & Shutter
		Electrically
			It's not a Floppy!
				It's not even a modded Zip/LS-/HiFD/UFD144/... drive
			Instead, it's an SSD with a protective Shutter!
				Simiar to the FloppySD

						 7 pins [SATA Data connector]
						16 pins [microSATA/SATA Slimline 3,3V/5V]
							https://pinoutguide.com/HD/SATA_micro_connector_pinout.shtml
					RFID - 125kHz
						Passive RFID Tag on each media - Read-Only
							i.e. EM4100
						Includes Media Information
							Interfaces
								Which interfaces are available at which speeds
									Optional Interfaces
							Type

						 8 pins
		Electro-Mechanically
			Instead of a magnetic or optical platter, the media has a set of contact pins protected by the shutter
				similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdIeka3-SI
			Drive "Head" basically contacts the media using LGA and pogo pins

			Media and Shutter provide a secure and rugged housing
				Protecting contacts from dirt, grease, ingress and other damages
					Common Problem with USB Flashdrives
						Connectors
							get filthy
								hard to clean
							get bent or break off
								hard to undo
			Sheetmetal Aluminium Case protects the media
